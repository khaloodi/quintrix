        Hi, my name is Khaled
        \n\nI love programming.
        \n\nI love learning new languages and building applications from scratch in Android, Python, and definitely JavaScript.
        \n\nFun fact is that I have german shepherd named Cece.
        \n\nI enjoy exercising, and swimming too. Cycling. Weight-lifting. Running - not so much.
        \nAnd sometimes I do cross fit.
        \nAnd even less sometimes, I do mixed martial arts.
        \n\nNow I teach a class in basic programming skills as while I am developing these small Android apps.
        \n\nI\'ll be happy to share all of the information I have learned through Udacity, Google, and Quintrix learnings.
        \n\nYou should ask me an interview question.
