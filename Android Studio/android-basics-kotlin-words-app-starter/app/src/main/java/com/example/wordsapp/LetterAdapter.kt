            Also, why do you think it's necessary to call toString()? The button's text is already a string, right?

            Sort of. It's actually of type CharSequence, which is something called an interface.
            You don't need to know anything about Kotlin interfaces for now, other than it's a way to
            ensure a type, such as String, implements specific functions and properties. You can think of
            a CharSequence as a more generic representation of a string-like class. A button's text property
            could be a string, or it could be any object that is also a CharSequence. The putExtra() method,
            however, accepts a String, not just any CharSequence, hence the need to call toString()
